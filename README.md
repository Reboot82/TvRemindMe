# Project 3

## Problem Statement

With all the new streaming services coming out, it can be hard to keep track of where your favorite shows are located, and even harder to remember when a new episode/season has aired. This application allows the user to set up a personal database of their favorite shows, and set premiere dates that will update the unwatched episodes, so that you never miss a new episode of your favorite program, regardless of where it airs.
